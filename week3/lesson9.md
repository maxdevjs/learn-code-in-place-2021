<summary>Q1: Code in Place Filter</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Write a program that asks the user to enter an image file, loads that file and applies the ‚ÄúCode in Place‚Äù filter.

To apply the Code in Place filter, you are going to change every pixel to have the following new red, green and blue values, based off the pixels old red, green and blue values:

```python
new red value = old red value * 1.5
new green value = old green value * 0.7
new blue value = old blue value * 1.5
```

<summary>Q2: Finding Forest Flames</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
We‚Äôre going to start by writing a function called `find_flames` (in the file `forest_fire.py`) that highlights the areas where a forest fire is active. You‚Äôre given a satellite image of Greenland‚Äôs 2017 fires (photo credit: Stef Lhermitte, Delft University of Technology). Your job is to detect all of the ‚Äúsufficiently red‚Äù pixels in the image, which are indicative of where fires are burning in the image. As we did in class with the ‚Äúredscreening‚Äù example, we consider a pixel ‚Äúsufficiently red‚Äù if its red value is greater than or equal to the average of the pixel‚Äôs three RGB values times a constant `INTENSITY_THRESHOLD`.

Recall that the average of a pixel, which has red, green and blue values is:

```python
average = (red + green + blue) / 3
```

Image

`Original forest fire image on left, and highlighted version of image on right.`

When you detect a ‚Äúsufficiently red‚Äù pixel in the original image, you set its red value to 255 and its green and blue values to 0. This will highlight the pixel by making it entirely red. For all other pixels (i.e., those that are not ‚Äúsufficiently red‚Äù), you should convert them to their grayscale equivalent, so that we can more easily see where the fire is originating from. You can grayscale a pixel by summing together its red, green, and blue values and dividing by three (finding the average), and then setting the pixel‚Äôs red, green, and blue values to all have this same ‚Äúaverage‚Äù value.

Once you highlight the areas that are on fire in the image (and greyscale all the remaining pixels), you should see an image like that shown on the right in the figure. On the left side of the example image, we should the original image for comparison.

Note: to make this algorithm work on different images of fire, select an appropriate `INTENSITY_THRESHOLD` value.

<summary>Q4 (optional; hard): Warhol Effect</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Write an algorithm that takes in a square patch like this photo of Simba the Dog:

<div>
<img src="imgs/simba.png">
</div>

And creates an image which has the patch copied 6 times (in 2 rows and 3 columns) where each patch gets re-colored. This effect is inspired by some of Andy Warhol‚Äôs paintings.

<div>
<img src="imgs/simba_.png">
</div>

We strongly recommend implementing a function, like so:

```python
def make_recolored_patch(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale):
```

Which returns a new colored patch. See the starter code for details.

Don‚Äôt try to match the colors in this example exactly. Experiment with different combinations of red_scale, green_scale and blue_scale. The pink Simba was generated by

```python
make_recolored_patch(1.5, 0, 1.5)
```

A few milestones:

<div>
<img src="imgs/simba1.png">
</div>

<div>
<img src="imgs/simba2.png">
</div>

Define other functions too! How about a function which adds a colored patch to the final_image at a given row, column?

```
