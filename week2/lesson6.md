<h3>Optional Extensions</h3>

Once youâ€™ve completed all the required parts of the assignment, you might want to consider adding some extensions. Extensions, you may recall, are things that are totally optional. Here are some extra programs to write if you are interested â€“ but feel free to just make something cool!

<h3>Extend Khansole Academy</h3>

You could consider extending your Khansole Academy program to, for example, add more problem types (subtraction, multiplication, division, and more). You could also consider problems beyond arithmetic. If you could build your own version of Khansole Academy, what would you use it to help people learn? Be creative and enjoy.

<h3>AI for Game of Nimm</h3>

Can you make a computer player that can always win in a game of Nimm?

<h3>Hailstones</h3>

A separate (optional) problem you could consider writing is based on a problem in Douglas Hofstadterâ€™s Pulitzer-prize-winning book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach. That book contains many interesting mathematical puzzles, many of which can be expressed in the form of computer programs. In Chapter XII, Hofstadter mentions a wonderful problem that is well within the scope of what you know. The problem can be expressed as follows:

<i>
Pick some positive integer and call it n.
If n is even, divide it by two.
If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Continue this process until n is equal to one.
</i>

On page 401 of the Vintage edition of his book, Hofstadter illustrates this process with the following example, starting with the number 15:

```
15 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 46
46 is even, so I take half: 23
23 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 70
70 is even, so I take half: 35
35 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 106
106 is even, so I take half: 53
53 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 160
160 is even, so I take half: 80
80 is even, so I take half: 40
40 is even, so I take half: 20
20 is even, so I take half: 10
10 is even, so I take half: 5
5 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 16
16 is even, so I take half: 8
8 is even, so I take half: 4
4 is even, so I take half: 2
2 is even, so I take half: 1
```

As you can see from this example, the numbers go up and down, but eventuallyâ€”at least for all numbers that have ever been triedâ€”comes down to end in 1. In some respects, this process is reminiscent of the formation of hailstones, which get carried upward by the winds over and over again before they finally descend to the ground. Because of this analogy, this sequence of numbers is usually called the Hailstone sequence, although it goes by many other names as well.

You might want to write a Python program that reads in a number from the user and then displays the Hailstone sequence for that number, just as in Hofstadterâ€™s book, followed by a line showing the number of steps taken to reach 1. For example, hereâ€™s a sample run of what such a program might look like (user input is in bold italics):

```
Enter a number: 17
17 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 52
52 is even, so I take half: 26
26 is even, so I take half: 13
13 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 40
40 is even, so I take half: 20
20 is even, so I take half: 10
10 is even, so I take half: 5
5 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 16
16 is even, so I take half: 8
8 is even, so I take half: 4
4 is even, so I take half: 2
2 is even, so I take half: 1
The process took 12 steps to reach 1
```

<summary>Mars Weight</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Last Monday, NASA made history with the first controlled flight on another planet. Its latest Mars Rover, Perseverance, has onboard a 50cm high helicopter called Ingenuity. On Sunday, Ingenuity made its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/science/mars-helicopter-nasa.html">third flight</a>, during which it flew faster and further than it had on any of its test flights on Earth. Interestingly, Ingenuity <a href="https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter">uses Python</a> for some of its flight modeling software!

When programming Ingenuity, one of the things that NASA engineers need to account for is the fact that due to the weaker gravity on Mars, an Earthling's weight on Mars is 37.8% of their weight on Earth. Write a Python program that prompts an Earthling to enter their weight on Earth and prints their calculated weight on Mars.

<summary>Weighted coin FIXME</summary>

<summary>Description</summary>
Write a program which will flip a weighted coin.

Coin flips are usually fair, but can be cheated -- a weighted coin is a coin where the probability of heads isn't 50%. Your code should use the random module to "flip" coin where the probability of heads is 70% and print the outcome (heads or tails).

Write a program which prompts the user to type an affirmation of your choice (we'll use "I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.") until they type it correctly.

<summary>Fibonacci FIXME</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Write a program to print terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum value.

In the 13th century, the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, as a way to explain the geometric growth of a population of rabbits, devised a mathematical sequence that now bears his name. The first two terms in this sequence, Fib(0) and Fib(1), are 0 and 1, and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two. Thus, the first several terms in the Fibonacci sequence look like this:

Fib(0) = 0
Fib(1) = 1
Fib(2) = 1 (0 + 1)
Fib(3) = 2 (1 + 1)
Fib(4) = 3 (1 + 2)
Fib(5) = 5 (2 + 3)

Write a program that displays the terms in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(0) and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10,000 (you should store this value as a constant!).

Write a program which asks a user for their age and lets them know if they can or can't vote in the following three fictional countries.

In the fictional countries of Peturksbouipo, Stanlau, and Mayengua, the voting ages are very different:

    the voting age in Peturksbouipo is 16 (in real life, this is the voting age in, for example, Scotland, Ethiopia, and Austria)

    the voting age in Stanlau is 25 (in real life this is the voting age in the United Arab Emirates)

    the voting age in Mayengua is 48 (in real life, as far as we can tell, this isn't the voting age anywhere)

Your code should prompt the for their age and print whether or not they can vote in Peturksbouipo, Stanlau, or Mayengua.
