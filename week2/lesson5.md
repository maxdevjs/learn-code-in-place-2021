<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
In this assignment we add one line of code to complete the story of Karel the Omniscient.

Mad Libs is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story!

No idea about it ðŸ¤”

<summary>Code</summary>

`madlibs.py`
```python
"""
Uses constants to tell a mad libs story.

# Fun fact: 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant,
# and it's a pretty mysterious number :)

WIZARD = 'Karel the Omniscient'
NUMBER_OF = 6174
FRUIT = 'mangoes'
PRICE = 2.99
YEARS = 300


def main():
    print("There once was a wizard by the name of " + WIZARD + " who loved to eat " + FRUIT + ".")
