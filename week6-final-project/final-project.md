# Final Project

## GOAL DEADLINE: Monday, MAY 31st, 11:59PM ANYWHERE ON EARTH

<summary>Guidelines</summary>
<br />
Your project could be small and humble or big and expansive. Both are great. All that we care about is that you make one thing that is yours. Examples of great projects could be: a word game on the console, a new image algorithm or filter of your design. It could even be a datascience challenge where you explore data (perhaps even the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">covid19</a> data).

Please ask for help on Ed if you have trouble (1) deciding on a good project, (2) getting started, (3) conceptual challenges. We are all one big team and we want to support one another.

We’ll be publishing the project showcase on June 1st, so we’d recommend submitting your project by then. If you want to make changes or submit later, you’ll be able to do so until the end of June, and the showcase will be updated periodically

<summary>Submission</summary>

Your final deliverable is a 2 minute video along with a title and a short description of what you have done. In the two minute video you can show your program running and explain what you have made. More details will be posted here next week.
