<summary>Q4: Cleanup Karel, Milestone 2 - Spoiler: Tests failed like ü¶æüòÄüòÇ</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Karel has a bit of spring cleaning to do! Karel's world will have beepers in some positions in the bottom row; write a program to have Karel walk across the bottom row and, at each position, pick up a beeper only if one is present. Notice that you've already written the code to check if a beeper is present and only pick up a beeper if one is there from the previous milestone -- you should use your code from the previous milestone as a helper function to help with the decomposition of this problem!

Additionally, note that Karel's starting position will never contain a beeper, so there's no need to check it.

For example, if this is the initial starting world, with some beepers in the first row:

<br />
<img width="600px" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/wrFTLPTbItmNInxXGsu6vf6Z" />
<br />

This should be the end result, with a clear bottom row:

<br />
<img width="600px" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/pR9y61NWe7bH7kJ5QaaIlOhn" />
<br />

We've provided you two worlds on which to test your code. You can toggle between them by changing the very last line in the file from run_karel_program('Cleanup1.w') to run_karel_program('Cleanup2.w') (and vice versa) -- you will likely need to press Run (it's fine if you do so without any code written) for the world change to take effect.

Beeper: (2, 1); 1
Beeper: (4, 1); 1
Beeper: (5, 1); 1
Karel: (1, 1); east
BeeperBag: 0
```

This code executed with no
evident drawback, but at submit time, it exploded ü¶æüòç:

```text
Test failed!
	Student program crashed with this error:
	File "/home/CleanupKarel.py", line 19, in main
	    if front_is_clear():
	KarelInfiniteException: Executed more than 20000 commands - Karel might be stuck in an infinite loop!
```

After a "little" logic improvement, it passed the tests:

`CleanupKarel.py`
```python
while front_is_clear():
        move()
        if beepers_present():
            while beepers_present():
                pick_beeper()
```

Beeper: (5, 1); 1
Beeper: (3, 1); 1
Beeper: (7, 1); 1

<summary>Q7: Midpoint (optional!) üí£</summary>
<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
As an exercise in solving algorithmic problems, program Karel to place a single beeper at the middle of 1st Street (aka Row). For example, say Karel starts in the 5x5 world pictured in the figure:

<br />
<img width="600px" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/pqkbrO0wYb8xNzxtFrfPIddw" />
<br />

Karel should end with Karel standing on a beeper in the following position:

<br />
<img width="600px" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/zGfurKGRTTf4nT9OmEo305HF" />
<br />

Note that the final configuration of the world should have only a single beeper at the midpoint of 1st Street. Along the way, Karel is allowed to place additional beepers wherever it wants to, but must pick them all up again before it finishes. Similarly, if Karel paints/colors any of the corners in the world, they must all be uncolored before Karel finishes.

In solving this problem, you may count on the following facts about the world:

- Karel starts at the bottom left corner, facing east, with an infinite number of beepers in its bag.
- The initial state of the world includes no interior walls or beepers.
- The world need not be square, but you may assume that it is at least as tall as it is wide.

Your program, moreover, can assume the following simplifications:

- If the width of the world is odd, Karel must put the beeper in the center square. If the width is even, Karel may drop the beeper on either of the two center squares.
- It does not matter which direction Karel is facing at the end of the run.

There are many different algorithms you can use to solve this problem so feel free to be creative!

You should make sure your program runs successfully in all of the following worlds (which are just a few different examples to test out the generality of your solution): Midpoint.w (default world), `Midpoint1.w`, `Midpoint2.w`, `Midpoint8.w` .

You can toggle between worlds by changing `Midpoint.w` in the last line of the file (which is currently `run_karel_program`('Midpoint.w') to the filename of your choice (make sure to include the quotation marks around the filename) and running your program.
