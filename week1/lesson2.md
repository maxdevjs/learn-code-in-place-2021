# Lesson 2 Control Flow April 21st

<details open>
<summary>Learning Goals</summary>
<br />

Learn how to use for loops to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. Learn to use a while loop to repeat a block of code, checking on a condition before each repetition. Learn to use an if statement which only executes a block of code 'if' a given condition passes!

## Control flow with Karel

This part presents a series of exercises in an incremental difficult degree. There are warmups for the `for` and while` loops, and if/else conditions.

`Note:` receiving a `Karel: No beepers left in bag` message is an amazing experience ðŸ¤¯

<summary>Description</summary>
Your next task is to execute a "safe pickup" -- Karel can pick up beepers, but not if none are present! Write a program which will check if a beeper is present at the position Karel is currently on and pick up a beeper if one is present (if there are no beepers present, Karel shouldn't do anything).

Two worlds are provided for your to test your code on -- on the world where Karel starts on a beeper, your code should get Karel to pick the beeper up. On the world where Karel stREADMEarts on a blank spot, your code shouldn't do anything.

We've provided you two 1x1 worlds (one with a beeper, one without) on which to test your code. You can toggle from the beeper-present world to the no-beeper world by changing the very last line in the file from run_karel_program('SafePickup1.w') to run_karel_program('SafePickup2.w') (and vice versa).
