# Lesson 2 Control Flow April 21st

<details open>
<summary>Learning Goals</summary>
<br />

Learn how to use for loops to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. Learn to use a while loop to repeat a block of code, checking on a condition before each repetition. Learn to use an if statement which only executes a block of code 'if' a given condition passes!

## Control flow with Karel

This part presents a series of exercises in an incremental difficult degree. There are warmups for the `for` and while` loops, and if/else conditions.

`Note:` receiving a `Karel: No beepers left in bag` message is an amazing experience ðŸ¤¯

Congratulations on beginning your coding journey! Karel welcomes you to Code in Place 2021. Your next task is to help Karel celebrate the occasion by placing 20 beepers, moving Karel one step, placing 21 beepers, and moving Karel one more step. The world should ultimately look like this:

<summary>Q3: Cleanup Karel, Milestone 1</summary>

<details open>
<summary>Description</summary>
Your next task is to execute a "safe pickup" -- Karel can pick up beepers, but not if none are present! Write a program which will check if a beeper is present at the position Karel is currently on and pick up a beeper if one is present (if there are no beepers present, Karel shouldn't do anything).

Two worlds are provided for your to test your code on -- on the world where Karel starts on a beeper, your code should get Karel to pick the beeper up. On the world where Karel stREADMEarts on a blank spot, your code shouldn't do anything.

We've provided you two 1x1 worlds (one with a beeper, one without) on which to test your code. You can toggle from the beeper-present world to the no-beeper world by changing the very last line in the file from run_karel_program('SafePickup1.w') to run_karel_program('SafePickup2.w') (and vice versa).
